# pregnancy-prototype-

## Intention

To address several article page types for the pregnancy section of the site. 

To create hub navigations based on the v1 sketch prototypes for further development

## User personas and journeys

This prototype is set up to test 3 differetn personas and user journeys

* Just found out they're pregnant
* 8-10 weeks pregnant and looking for information about their first set of scans
* Nearly reading to give birth and pregnant person or partner of regnant person and looking to get ready for the birth.

## Structure

The site is built relying heavily on HTML includes for repeatable links and promo boxes.

The code is using the nhs toolkit and the main concentration of the work is in the I'm Pregnant section.

There's only one workable link in the *Getting Pregnant* section - *Signs and symptoms of pregnancy* but there is a lot of dummy content for that hub page.

There are several workable sections within *I'm pregnant* including:

* Antenatal (Your pregnancy journey)
* Early days
* Tests and scans
* Weeks 1 - 8
* Weeks 9 - 12
* Weeks 37 - 42

The *Labour and birth* section has 2 workable sections with clickable content:

* The start of labour
* The birth

## Testing intent

The site was built to answer certain, specific questions

* Task 1: Can the user find their way to Early Days > To Do OR Weeks 1-8 > weeks 1-3, 4,5 OR Signs and symptoms of pregnancy

* Task 2: Can the user find their way to Tests & Scans > Antenatal scans OR Antenatal checks OR Testing for Downs...

* Task 3: Can the user find their way to Labour and birth > Pack your bag OR Pain relief OR Signs that labour has begun OR How to make a birth plan

* Questions
..* Can they understand the structure of the content?
..* Do they understand what information they can get?
..* Is any of the content worrying? Is any of the content confusing?
..* Is it clear that the contextual links relate to the content above?
..* Are the contextual link boxes easy to understand and read?
..* Are the breadcrumbs confusing?
..* Are the sub heading (parent canons) confusing? Should they be clickable?
