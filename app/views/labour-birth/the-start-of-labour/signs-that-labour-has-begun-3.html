  <h2>How to cope when labour begins</h2>

	<p>At the beginning of labour, you can:
		<ul>
			<li>walk or move about, if you feel like it</li>
			<li>drink fluids – you may find sports (isotonic) drinks help keep your energy levels up</li>
			<li>have a snack, although many women don't feel very hungry and some feel, or are, sick</li>
			<li>try any relaxation and breathing exercises you've learned to deal with contractions as they get stronger and more painful – your birth partner can help by doing these with you</li>
			<li>have your birth partner rub your back – this can help relieve pain</li>
			<li>take paracetamol according to the instructions on the packet – paracetamol is safe to take in labour </li>
			<li>have a warm bath</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
