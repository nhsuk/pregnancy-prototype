      <h3>If you're not sure you want to be pregnant</h3>
      <p>If you're not sure about continuing with the pregnancy, you can discuss this confidentially with a healthcare professional. Your options are:
        <ul>
          <li>continuing with the pregnancy and keeping the baby</li>
          <li>having an abortion</li>
          <li>continuing with the pregnancy and having the baby adopted</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>As well as a GP or a nurse at your GP surgery, you can also get accurate, confidential information – from the age of 13 – from the following:
        <ul>
          <li>a community sexual health clinic</li>
          <li>the Marie Stopes website</li>
          <li>the FPA: pregnant and don't know what to do leaflet</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>All these services – including community contraceptive clinics – are confidential. If you're 13 or older, the staff won't tell your parents. They'll encourage you to talk to your parents, but they won't force you.</p>
      <p>If you're under 25 and would prefer advice specifically for young people, the sexual health charity Brook provides a range of services for young people. The Brook website contains information on pregnancy choices. You can also use the Ask Brook 24/7 service.</p>
