    <p>This page provides links to all the pages and topics relating to being in the very early start of your pregnancy. Your weeks of pregnancy are dated from the first day of your last period. This means that in the first 2 weeks or so, you aren't actually pregnant â€“ your body is preparing for ovulation (releasing an egg from one of your ovaries) as usual.</p>
