    <p>Your weeks of pregnancy are dated from the first day of your last period.</p>

    <p>This means that in the first 2 weeks or so, you aren't actually pregnant – your body is preparing for ovulation (releasing an egg from one of your ovaries) as usual.</p>

      <p>Your "getting pregnant" timeline is:
      <ul>
        <li>day 1: the first day of your period</li>
        <li>day 14 (or slightly before or after, depending how long your menstrual cycle is): you ovulate</li>
        <li>within 24 hours of ovulation, the egg is fertilised by sperm if you have had sex in the last few days without using contraception</li>
        <li>about 5 to 6 days after ovulation, the fertilised egg burrows into the lining of the womb – this is called implantation</li>
        <li>you're now pregnant</li>

      <h2>Things to think about</h2>
      <p>In the early days and weeks of pregnancy, you may not know if you're pregnant.</p>

      <p>But you can do the following things:
        <ul>
          <li>take a folic acid supplement of 400 micrograms (400mcg) a day while you're trying to get pregnant and until the 12th week of pregnancy</li>
          <li>consider taking a vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms (10mcg) a day</li>
          <li>avoid some foods to protect against infections</li>
          <li>not smoking is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health</li>
          <li>You can get supplements from pharmacies and supermarkets, or your GP may be able to prescribe them for you.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>If you want to get your vitamin D or folic acid from a multivitamin tablet, make sure the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol).</p>

      <p>You can get vitamin supplements containing folic acid and vitamin D free of charge if you're under 18, pregnant or breastfeeding and qualify for the Healthy Start scheme.</p>

      <p>The first thing most women notice is that their period doesn't arrive.</p>
      <p>Find out about the signs and symptoms of pregnancy</p>
      <p>The most reliable way of finding out if you're pregnant is to take a pregnancy test.</p>
      <p>Once you think you could be pregnant, it's important to get in touch with a midwife or doctor to start your pregnancy (antenatal) care.</p>

      <p>You can do this by contacting:
        <ul>
          <li>your GP surgery – if you're not registered with a GP, you can find local GP surgeries</li>
          <li>your local hospital's maternity unit – find local maternity services</li>
        </ul>
