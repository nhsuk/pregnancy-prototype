    <p>You should see a midwife or GP as soon as you find out you're pregnant. This is so they can organise your NHS pregnancy care (also called antenatal care).</p>
    <p>Your first appointment with a midwife should happen before you're 10 weeks pregnant.</p>
    <p>If you're more than 10 weeks pregnant and haven't seen a GP or midwife, contact a GP or midwife as soon as possible. They'll see you quickly and help you start your NHS pregnancy care.</p>
