      <h2>What is antenatal care?</h2>
      <p>
        This is the care you receive while you're pregnant to make sure you and your baby are as well as possible.</p>
        <p>The midwife or doctor providing your antenatal care will: 
          <ul>
            <li>check the health of you and your baby</li>
            <li>give you useful information to help you have a healthy pregnancy (including advice about healthy eating and exercise)</li>
            <li>discuss your options and choices for your care during pregnancy, labour and birth </li>
            <li>answer any questions you may have</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>All mums-to-be in England are offered:
        <ul>
          <li>two pregnancy ultrasound scans â€“ at <strong>8 to 14 weeks</strong>, and <strong>18 to 21 weeks</strong></li>
          <li>antenatal screening tests to find out the chance of your baby having certain conditions, such as Down's syndrome</li>
          <li>blood tests to check for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B</li>
          <li>screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You will also be offered antenatal classes, including breastfeeding workshops. You may need to book these in advance, so ask your midwife about classes in your area.</p>

      <h2>Starting antenatal care</h2>
      <p>You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with your midwife as soon as you find out you're pregnant.</p>
      <p>Your GP surgery or a Children's Centre can put you in touch with your nearest midwifery service. You can find your nearest Children's Centre through your local council.</p>
      <p>It's best to see a midwife or GP as early as possible to get the information you need about having a healthy pregnancy. Some tests, such as screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia, should be done before you're 10 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they will all be involved in your care during pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour. If you don't speak English, tell your midwife.</p>
